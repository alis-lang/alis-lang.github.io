title = 'Alis Language Specification'
+++
The Alis Lannguage Specification defines the requirements around which the
language and its tools are to be built. Currently, the specification is not
fully concrete, and a lot of parts may be vague, or some actually implemented
features may be undocumented. It is currently a work-in-progress.
